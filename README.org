* htmx and Go

Web server:
- serves static files
- handles dynamic form data
- persists state after browser refresh
- new content updates in-place without full page refresh (thanks to htmx)

This basic set of functionality comes from ~50 lines of Go, ~35 of HTML (with Go templates) and some CSS.

I'm using [[https://github.com/air-verse/air][air]] to rebuild whenever the dependencies change; it's one less thing to remember (still have to refresh the browser to test some things).
